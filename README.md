# Color-Image-Overenhancement-Dataset
We introduce the **Subjective Enhanced Image Dataset (SEID)** which is specifically focused on **image over-enhancement**. This dataset could not only be used in studies focused on **detecting over-enhancement** in images but also for **proposing new IQMs for enhanced images**.
