# How Good is Too Good? A Subjective Study on Over Enhancement of Images
# CIC 2021

**Abstract**
The **SEID** dataset consists of 30 reference images. To select the reference images in our dataset we focused on complementing the already available datasets in the field of image contrast enhancement. Keeping this goal in mind, the reference images in the SEID dataset were selected from already available images in the CEED (18 images) and CCEID (12 images) datasets. The primary goal of our study is to investigate **over-enhancement** in images. That is, to find the point in which an increase in contrast in the case of low-contrast images and a decrease in contrast in the case of high-contrast images will result in the degradation of image quality. To this end, a subjective experiment was designed.
